# Game Plan:

Gameplay Description:
An improved version of the base game 5 I did. Instead of mining, the players gets to choose how to distribute their points, and chooses from a pool of spells that do different things. they get to pick, say, 3 spells from a pool of 10 that each have its own animation and gameplay effect. Mana and health will be refreshed between battles. If they lose all their health, they will be given the option of restarting the battle or going back to the title screen. When they finish all their battles, they obtain the treasure, win the game, and are sent back to the title screen. 

Input:
Player interacts with sliders for their stat values, and buttons to choose attacks and make choices. 

Visual Style:
Old D&D type, dragons, slime-type monsters. 

Audio Style:
Basic adventure-type music, maybe somewhat gloomier for a cave-type environment. 

Interface Sketches:
Not sure how to sketch an interface here. Buttons for attacks displayed at the bottom of the screen, battle shown in the midscreen, with narration text included at the top. 

Story/Theme Description:
Player is taking a quest to go into a dungeon to find the treasure, and must "train for their adventure" (choose how their stats are distributed based on this). They come upon different monsters and must bravely fight them in order to reach the end. 

# Low-Bar:
Basic combat, UI, audio, and visuals all function properly.
Player has a way to win and lose, and these methods can each be reasonably achieved by a player and function properly.
Gameplay works, even if it isn't necessarily tuned well.
Spells are all usable, but may not have proper animations. 
At least one fight is completed.

# Target:
Each player and enemy attack has its own animation
Gameplay flows smoothly and is reasonably balanced. 
Enemies have more than one attack.
Game looks reasonably good, nothing sticks out like a sore thumb or looks terrible. 

# High-Bar:
Each enemy has different elemental weaknesses that are affected by the spells the player chooses. 
More detailed enemy attacks, such as charging up attacks that the player can use block spells for, and more advanced enemy behavior, such as using certain attacks at certain health ranges. 
Gameplay is finely balanced with multiple viable spell choices and combinations that each make for a unique gameplay experience.
Creating more battles for the player.
