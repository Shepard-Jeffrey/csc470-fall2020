# Game Overview:

My game will be a cross of a mining-type game and a turn-based RPG. Players will first get a small amount of time (probably somewhere between 30 seconds and two minutes) to mine from 3 materials that raise a corresponding stat of Strength, Defense, and Magic (MP). Each will be represented with an increasing stat as the player mines. At the end of that time limit, they will be transported to a boss fight with an enemy, where they can choose to either attack, or use stronger magic (presuming that they have mined the MP for it), with magic attacks consuming the mined magic. Damage done with basic attacks, as well as damage recieved from the enemy will be proportional to Strength and Defense mined. 

# Technical enhancements:

 A controlled unit has to "mine" materials and increase a number by clicking on a gameobject that it has contact with.

 Small animation for giving and taking damage in combat with the enemy, with optional stretch goal of animation for mining as well. 

 Turn-based actions in combat.

 UI elements/numbers affecting damage taken and given in combat. 

 Moving the player unit to the boss fight while retaining the variables for each mined element.
 
 UI elements consicely narrating attacks used by player and enemy.
